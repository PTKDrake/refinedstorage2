The {doctitle} places items or fluids from the storage network in the world.

No other blocks can be in front of the {doctitle} (except fluids) and it should be possible for the block to be placed (for example: saplings need dirt).

The {doctitle} can also drop items in the world instead of placing actual blocks.
When provided with a xref:../upgrades/stack-upgrade.adoc[], it'll drop stacks of items at a time.
