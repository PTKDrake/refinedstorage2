****
The {doctitle} has been removed in version v1.7.0-alpha.

A Reader has the ability to manage {doctitle} / xref:writer.adoc[] channels on a network.

The {doctitle} is a block that takes items, fluids, energy and / or a redstone signal.
The data will be transmitted to the configured channel and can be read out with a xref:writer.adoc[].

The {doctitle} doesn't auto-extract any of the supported types (with an exception to redstone signals).
You have to insert it manually.

== Supported types

- Items
- Fluids
- Energy
- Redstone
