****
The {doctitle} has been removed in version v1.7.0-alpha.
****

A {doctitle} has the ability to manage xref:reader.adoc[] / {doctitle} channels on a network.

The {doctitle} is a block that exposes items, fluids, energy and / or a redstone signal from the bound channel.
The data that is received is sent from the xref:reader.adoc[].

The {doctitle} doesn't auto-push any of the supported types (with an exception to redstone signals).
You have to extract it manually.

== Supported types

- Items
- Fluids
- Energy
- Redstone
