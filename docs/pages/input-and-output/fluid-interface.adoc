= Fluid Interface
:icon: fluid-interface.png
:from: v0.9.0-beta

The {doctitle} is the same as an xref:interface.adoc[] but for fluids.

It has 2 internal tanks, one for input and one for output.

== Input slot

The {doctitle} has an input slot to import the contents of fluid containers (like a filled bucket).

You can also interact with the input tank by using pipes from other mods.

== Output configuration

- Click a fluid container (like a filled bucket) in the "Out" slot to configure the output fluid.
- Use left or right click on the fluid to change the mB amount.
- Use shift to clear the fluid slot.
- You can also interact with the output tank by using pipes from other mods.
