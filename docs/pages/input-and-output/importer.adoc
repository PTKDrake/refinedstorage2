:from: v0.3.0-alpha

The {doctitle} imports items or fluids from an inventory in front of the block and inserts it in the storage network (if there is space).

By default, it will import all accessible slots (place the {doctitle} on the correct side, where the slot or fluid tank is reachable) but the player can use the allowlist or blocklist as well.

== Allowlist and blocklist

There is also a allowlist and blocklist option to only allow or forbid some items from entering the storage network.

The allowlist or blocklist can be configured to be NBT or damage sensitive.
