:icon: wireless-crafting-monitor.png
:from: v1.2.1

With the {doctitle} the player can see what is crafting from anywhere.

To activate the {doctitle}, the player has to right click the {doctitle} on a xref:../networking/controller.adoc[].
If you're playing on Refined Storage v1.7.x or higher you can bind the {doctitle} by right clicking on any connected network device.

To use the {doctitle} the item needs Forge Energy.
You'll have to charge it in a block that charges items from another mod.

After doing all these steps, the {doctitle} is still missing a signal from the system.
Add at least 1 xref:wireless-transmitter.adoc[] to the network to get a basic range of 16 blocks.

If the {doctitle} is ready for use, it will light up blue.

== Troubleshooting

Sometimes, the {doctitle} doesn't open or stays grey.
To enable it make sure that:

- The {doctitle} is bound to a xref:../networking/controller.adoc[]
- There is at least 1 xref:wireless-transmitter.adoc[] connected to the network
- That you are in range of the xref:wireless-transmitter.adoc[]
- The xref:../networking/controller.adoc[] block is still in the world on the place where you bound it to

== Energy behavior

The {doctitle} draws energy on following actions:
