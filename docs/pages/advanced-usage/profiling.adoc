= Profiling

If you have a performance, it's best to make a `.nps` file that you can send to the developers so that they can investigate further.

== Installing Sampler

Sampler is a mod by Player that generates .nps files.
You can download it from link:https://forum.industrial-craft.net/thread/10820[here].

=== For Minecraft 1.12

=== For Minecraft 1.11

link:http://files.player.to/sampler-1.72.1.jar[http://files.player.to/sampler-1.72.1.jar]

=== For Minecraft 1.10

link:http://files.player.to/sampler-1.69.3.jar[http://files.player.to/sampler-1.69.3.jar]

== Running Sampler

Then you can `/sampler start` and `/sampler stop` while it's lagging.

Then a simple `/sampler export [name of exported nps file here]` will write out the .nps file that can be read by the developers in VisualVM.

== Where to run Sampler?

- Is it a performance on the server, like tick lag?
Run Sampler *on the server*, NOT on your client!
- Is it a performance on the client, like FPS lag?
Run Sampler *on the client*, NOT on your server!
