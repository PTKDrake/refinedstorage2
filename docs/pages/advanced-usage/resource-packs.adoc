== Color settings

You can change the text colors that Refined Storage uses in its GUIs by changing the `pack.mcmeta` file.

Example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 4,
    "description": "An example"
  },
  "refinedstorage": {
    "primary_color": 11184810,
    "secondary_color": 11184810
  }
}
----

`primary_color` is used for the GUI titles, `secondary_color` is used for all the rest.

The color is an integer representation of an RGBA color.
