The {doctitle} is a block that emits a redstone signal if an item, or fluid count matches a given amount.

It is also possible to be NBT or damage sensitive.

== Types of criteria

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Criteria|Explanation

|<|Emits a signal when lower than the given amount
|>|Emits a signal when higher than the given amount
|=|Emits a signal when equal to the given amount
|===

== Checking the total count in the storage

When no item/fluid, is specified, the criteria won't care about the count of a specific item/fluid, but rather the count of all items/fluids, in the storage.

== Amounts in fluid mode

When the {doctitle} is in fluid mode, the amount given is in millibuckets (mB).

If you want to check for 1 bucket of a fluid, use 1000, not 1.
