:from: v1.8.3-beta

The Regulator Upgrade is an upgrade that can be inserted into an xref:../input-and-output/exporter.adoc[] to keep certain items or fluids in stock in the connected inventory.

It will try to keep the connected inventory stocked by using items or fluids from the storage network.

As soon as the upgrade is inserted, you can right click on a filtered item or fluid in the xref:../input-and-output/exporter.adoc[] GUI to configure the amount to keep in stock.

Additionally, the Regulator Upgrade can be combined with a xref:crafting-upgrade.adoc[] to start autocrafting tasks when the stock from the storage network runs out.

By using this upgrade, the amount of FE/t that this device draws will increase.
