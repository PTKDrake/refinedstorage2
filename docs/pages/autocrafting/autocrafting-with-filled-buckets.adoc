= Autocrafting with filled buckets

Some crafting recipes may require a filled fluid bucket.
To use fluids from your fluid storage to fill buckets, you can set up a xref:pattern.adoc#_processing[processing pattern] that has following inputs:

- 1 empty bucket
- 1000 mB of the fluid of your choice

For the output:

- 1 filled bucket

Put that in a xref:crafter.adoc[] that faces a bucket filling machine (link:https://teamcofh.com/docs/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/[that for example Thermal Expansion has]).
Refined Storage will output the fluid from your fluid storage, and, an empty bucket.
It is up to the external machine to fill it.
