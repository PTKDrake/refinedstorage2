= Processing Pattern Encoder
:icon: processing-pattern-encoder.png
:from: v0.6.0-alpha
:to: v1.5.6

[.alert.alert-warning]
****
The {doctitle} has been removed in v1.5.6 and its functionality has been moved to the xref:pattern-grid.adoc[].
****

A {doctitle} is used to create xref:pattern.adoc[patterns] meant for machine automation.

It takes up to 9 inputs and 9 outputs, so the storage network knows what to take and what to expect.

This block can't be connected to a storage network.

== Recipe transferring

The {doctitle} integrates with link:https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jei[JEI (Just Enough Items)] so the player can use recipe transferring.

When using this, Refined Storage will use the inputs and outputs that the link:https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jei[JEI] recipe has.
