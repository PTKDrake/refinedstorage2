= Keeping items in stock

Create an xref:../input-and-output/interface.adoc[] with a xref:../upgrades/crafting-upgrade.adoc[] in it.
Then, specify the items that you want to keep in stock.
The items will now be autocrafted if needed.

To make the stocked items available to your storage network, create an xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] and put it on the xref:../input-and-output/interface.adoc[].

Make sure the xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] is in "extract-only" mode.
That way, Refined Storage won't attempt to insert items in the xref:../input-and-output/interface.adoc[] that is meant for keeping in stock.
