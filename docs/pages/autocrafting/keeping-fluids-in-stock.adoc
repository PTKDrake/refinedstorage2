= Keeping fluids in stock

Keeping fluids in stock work the same way as xref:keeping-items-in-stock.adoc[keeping items in stock].

Create a xref:../input-and-output/fluid-interface.adoc[] with a xref:../upgrades/crafting-upgrade.adoc[] in it.
Then, specify the fluid that you want to keep in stock by clicking a fluid container (like a bucket) in the "out" slot.
You can change the amount by left or right clicking on the fluid.
The fluids will now be autocrafted if needed.

To make the stocked fluids available to your storage network, create an xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] and put it on the xref:../input-and-output/fluid-interface.adoc[].
Put the xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] in fluid mode.

Make sure the xref:../storage/external-storage.adoc[] is in "extract-only" mode.
That way, Refined Storage won't attempt to insert fluids in the xref:../input-and-output/fluid-interface.adoc[] that is meant for keeping in stock.
