A {doctitle} is an item used to hide xref:../networking/cable.adoc[cables].

You can also hide blocks that have a cable on them, like the xref:../input-and-output/importer.adoc[] or xref:../input-and-output/exporter.adoc[].

It will block network connections, xref:../networking/cable.adoc[cables] can't pass through the "hidden" side.

They can be removed by sneaking and right-clicking them with the xref:wrench.adoc[].
