The Disk Drive is the block in which you store xref:index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disks] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_disks[fluid storage disks].

== Priority

A (negative or positive) priority can be chosen (where a higher priority gets higher precedence to place items in).

== Whitelist and blacklist

There is also a whitelist and blacklist to only allow or forbid some items or fluids from entering the xref:index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disks] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_disks[fluid storage disks] respectively.

The whitelist or blacklist can be configured to be NBT or damage sensitive.

== Mode

The Disk Drive has support for the following modes:

- Insert and extract (default)
- Insert only
- Extract only
