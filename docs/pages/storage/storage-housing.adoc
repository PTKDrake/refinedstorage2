:from: v0.6.0-alpha

A Storage Housing is a xref:index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disk] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_disks[fluid storage disk] without any xref:index.adoc#_storage_parts[storage part] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_parts[fluid storage part] assigned to it.

The player can craft another xref:index.adoc#_storage_disks[storage disk] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_disks[fluid storage disk] with this item by combining the Storage Housing with a xref:index.adoc#_storage_parts[storage part] or xref:index.adoc#_fluid_storage_parts[fluid storage part] respectively.
