= Design philosophy

== Consistency and simplicity
Refined Storage aims to provide a consistent and simple user experience.

- Features should work the same across all modpacks.
- Avoid feature toggles and config options that alter fundamental behaviors.
- Keep the experience predictable to reduce confusion, but still allow for complexity.

== No feature flags or configurable behaviors
Refined Storage does not support feature flags or config options for individual features.

Why?

- Configurable features create different user experiences across modpacks.
- For the end-user, this may become confusing.
- Debugging and support become harder when different configurations exist.
- Hinders maintenance and increases code complexity.

== Avoiding redundancy with other mods
Refined Storage does not aim to replicate features from other mods but rather focuses on storage networks.

== Addon-based expansion
Refined Storage follows an addon model for additional functionality and integrations.

- Core functionality remains stable and minimal.
- New or experimental features are first introduced as addons.
- Addons allow for independent evolution without bloating base Refined Storage.

== Quality of life and balance
Quality of Life (QoL) improvements should be carefully considered.

- Over-optimization of actions can reduce the sense of mastery.
- Balance between ease of use and gameplay depth is critical.
- Maintaining a "peaceful" user experience is a core principle.

== Conclusion

Refined Storage is designed to be **simple, predictable, and modular**. The focus remains on storage networks while allowing addons to expand and innovate. The mod avoids feature flags, redundant functionality, and excessive QoL changes to maintain a balanced and cohesive experience.
