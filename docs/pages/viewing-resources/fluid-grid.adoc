= Fluid Grid
:from: v0.9.0-beta
:icon: fluid-grid.png

The {doctitle} is the same as a regular xref:grid.adoc[], but is used for viewing fluids in the fluid storage of your storage network.

== Inserting

To insert a fluid, players can shift click on a fluid container like a bucket in their player inventory while in the {doctitle} GUI.

The player can also click the fluid container in the GUI to insert it.

== Extracting

Players can extract the fluid by clicking on it.
The {doctitle} will then fill a bucket with the selected fluid.

Refined Storage will first search an empty bucket in your inventory.
If none is found, a bucket will be searched in your storage network.

Some fluids cannot be filled in a bucket, then the only way to extract those fluids is by using an xref:../input-and-output/exporter.adoc[].
