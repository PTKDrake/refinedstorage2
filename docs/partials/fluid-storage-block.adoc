The {doctitle} is a block that provides the system with storage.
It is similar to the xref:../pages/storage/index.adoc#_fluid_storage_disks[fluid storage disk], but can be placed in the world.

When breaking the {doctitle}, the fluids that it holds persist, so you won't lose any of your fluids.

The {doctitle} won't despawn when dropped in the world.

== Priority

A (negative or positive) priority can be chosen (where a higher priority gets higher precedence to place items in).

== Whitelist and blacklist

There is also a whitelist and blacklist option to only allow or forbid some fluid from entering the {doctitle}.

The whitelist or blacklist can be configured to be NBT or damage sensitive.

== Mode

The {doctitle} has support for the following modes:

- Insert and extract (default)
- Insert only
- Extract only

== Uncrafting

Sneak and right click while holding the empty {doctitle} to retrieve the various parts back:
